# Git and GitHub Practice

## This is a homework assignment.

In it, I have done the following:

1. Made a directory called git_and_gh_practice

2. Added two files to the directory

3. Initialized git on the directory

4. Made changes to both files, and moved them to "staged" status.

5. Committed both with a comment of "Initial Commit"

6. Created a GitHub Repository of the same name

7. Added a remote to my local repository

8. Pushed my local git to GitHub

## Thoughts/Issues

  *The only issue I had was I didn't commit my local git before trying to add remote.  This created an error because I had no committed files to add.  I then tried to add info line by line, and got another error saying the folders were already created.  I realized I had linked my local and remote, but just hadn't committed my local.  Once I did that everything worked properly.

  *I now feel pretty good about this.  I went through the change, add, commit, push process for about 30 minutes after class last night.
